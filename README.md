Computer science logic: representing throguh logic gates 

Introducing half adder:
A half adder is a basic digital circuit that *adds two one bits* (Take X and Y), to produce a Sum (S) and a carry (C).

To represent these with logic gates, we need to be introduced to the XOR and AND gate:

A XOR or Exclusive OR gate oupts a 0 if the input is the same, and 1 if the inputs are different. It acts as an **inequality detector**, or **anti-coincidence gate**. 
XOR Gate truth table:
| (Bit 1 input) X  | (Bit 2 input) Y | (Output) Q |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0  | 0 | 0  |
| 0  | 1  | 1 |
| 1  | 0  | 1  |
| 1  | 1  | 0  | 

*Constructed using AND, OR and NOT, (first row of the truth table below)*
